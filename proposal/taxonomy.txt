- MPLS
  - not programmable
  - highly virtualized - ???
  - MPLS-TP
    - more deterministic, no ECMP, no LSP merge, no PHP
      - wat is dat?
    - control over resources
    - bi-directional LSPs
    - OAM, CC and PM
    - fast failover
  - MPLS-TE
    - CSPF extensive control over resources and traffic flows
    - FRR allows fast failover
  - network separation
    - PWE3
    - L3VPN
    - L2VPN (VPLS)
  - GMPLS
    - L1VPN
- SDN
  - central overview over resources, application can tell requirements
  - OpenFlow
    - network programmability
  - OpenDaylight
    - northbound API to control controller
- NFV
  - network separation
  - limited programmability
- PBB
  - no programmability
  - separation through S-TAGs put in to (H-)VPLS
- TRILL
  - 
- NetCONF
  - limited network programmability
- SDH/SONET
  - network separation
  - not programmable (not needed?)
