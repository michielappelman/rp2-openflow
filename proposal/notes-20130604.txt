Virtualization
 - to get flexible hardware
 - resources
 - separation

Control over:
 - changes
 - resources
 - failures
 - maintenance

Virtualization/separation of resources, control over those resources.

Use-case: making dynamic VPNs between users (over multiple domains) for example using MPLS tags in OpenFlow

what are the architectural components? tables, databases?

North-bound API, what does it look like? What abstractions do you need?

What interface do you need?

Taxonomy:
 - what is available? state of the art
 - features?
 - what does it (allow you to) accomplish?
 - why is it there?

NFV = separate from OpenFlow -> complementary even
 - >NFV allows OpenFlow instances, OpenFlow can control NFV instances

Virtual Routing -> NFV instance
Virtual Routing Table -> programmable by OpenFlow
