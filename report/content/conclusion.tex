% TODO: Pro's and cons

MPLS lacks in manageability .. because of the large increasing stack of network protocols and there is no defined interface to configure them

SDN architecture can solve complexity by providing network abstraction to applications
BUT until Northbound interface is defined, flexibility still limited

OpenFlow missing Fast Recovery in forwarding plane, but research is ongoing
