% TODO: Pro's and cons

MPLS lacks in manageability .. because of the large increasing stack of network protocols and there is no defined interface to configure them

While discussing the implementation of \ac{mpls} for \acp{dvpn} we found that the stack was overly engineered and due to its cumulative nature, getting more and more complex. 

SDN architecture can solve complexity by providing network abstraction to applications
BUT until Northbound interface is defined, flexibility still limited

OpenFlow missing Fast Recovery in forwarding plane, but research is ongoing
