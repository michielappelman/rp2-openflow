%%% ATM %%
%
%As mentioned, \ac{atm} provides \ac{qos} to the network operators and it also allows for the granular control of network paths -- called circuits -- but at a price. The \acp{vc} in an \ac{atm} network have to be tightly managed for the network to function properly, which limits its dynamism and scalability. Together with the Ethernet/\acs{ip} interoperability issues (causing it to move into increasing disuse), \ac{atm} does not make it a viable candidate to implement \acp{dvpn}.

%% SPB %%


Simplicity of setup comes at a cost:
\begin{itemize}
	\item no \ac{te}
	\item limited \ac{ecmp}
	\item no fast failover
\end{itemize}

%% MPLS %%



Because of its extensibility the \ac{mpls} technology and the added protocols and tools, it is commonly used in \acp{cen} as an alternative to legacy \acs{atm} and \acs{sdh} networks. With added features such as \ac{ecmp}, \ac{frr} and explicit routing it has proven to be a technology fit for carriers to transport critical application traffic over large networks

How did it do?

What are the differences?



These features are essential for implementing \acp{vpn} because the traffic flows will need to be separated upon entering the carrier network for MAC scalability.

MAC Scalability only from 1.0 onwards.
